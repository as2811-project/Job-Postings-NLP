An NLP project submitted as part of my coursework at RMIT. Over ~700 job postings (data folder) were read, tokenized and used to build a model to predict job category based on the job description. Logistic Regression was used for prediction, achieving ~91% accuracy. LightGBM was also used separately but yielded a considerably less accurate model. The model is then used in a Flask web application (a job posting site).
